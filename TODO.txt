---- files ----

* project-files manager
* collect files
    * open/save zipped projects with files


----- GUI -----

* fix positioning in ObjectTreeView (below/above... need to account for the sorted proxymodel)

    --- TrackView / Sequencer ---

    * scroll to selection on resize
    * highlight selected track
    * fix issue with track-select (sometimes not working)

* application settings dialog
    * especially colors, fonts, pens and brushes

---- Objects ----

* fade between different Cameras

* find concept for Microphones as part of Camera
    Basically, Microphones can be anywhere, but when they are part of a camera,
    they need to be faded in/out with the Camera.
    Also there should be a preset and uniform parameter edit for multiple Microphones

* maybe make ParameterFloat work with equations

* maybe ParameterFloat as modulator
    (would be nice to have e.g. a frequency value to control the frequency of a lot of sequences
    without creating a track/sequence for it)

* concept for copy/paste of objects that are modulated
    (maybe: when pasting modulated objects, open a dialog for selection of which
    modulators should be reused or recreated)

---- threading -----

* make equation threadsafe
* preserve a thread-storage for the gui (displaying of sequences and such)
* generally conceptualize thread-storage

---- OpenGL -----

* Shaders
    * text objects and #include support
* concept and implementation of a generic Model container and a Model renderer

* multi-projection

---- Networking ----

* concept anyway
* scene and scene-changes passing to clients

---- timeline ----

* adjustable derivatives
* display time/value
* numerically edit time/value
