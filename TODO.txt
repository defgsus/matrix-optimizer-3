---- files ----

* project-files manager
* collect files
    * open/save zipped projects with files

---- geometry ----

- OK make GeometryFactory/Dialog accessible through simple building/modifications blocks, yah!!

----- GUI -----

* fix positioning in ObjectTreeView (below/above... need to account for the sorted proxymodel)

* fix not-working tabOrder for ParameterView widgets (das ging doch eben noch!)

    --- TrackView / Sequencer ---

    * scroll to selection on resize
    * highlight selected track
    * BUG: fix issue with track-select (sometimes not working)

* application settings dialog
    * especially colors, fonts, pens and brushes

- OK SequenceFloatView: fix difference in update of phaseInDegree between oscillators and wavetable

---- math ----

* fix negative time issue in Spectral Oscillator mode
- OK fix microphone transformation (not working correctly, when e.g. a sound is attached to
    microphone and the microphone rotates around)

---- Objects ----

- OK fade between different Cameras

* find concept for Microphones as part of Camera
    Basically, Microphones can be anywhere, but when they are part of a camera,
    they need to be faded in/out with the Camera.
    Also there should be a preset and uniform parameter edit for multiple Microphones

* maybe make ParameterFloat work with equations

- OK maybe ParameterFloat as modulator
    (would be nice to have e.g. a frequency value to control the frequency of a lot of sequences
    without creating a track/sequence for it)
    - now doable with ModulatorFloatObject

* concept for copy/paste of objects that are modulated
    (maybe: when pasting modulated objects, open a dialog for selection of which
    modulators should be reused or recreated)

* make querying for camera fbos independent of the object order
  best to issue a signal when fbos change anyway!

* add .mo3-gui files to SceneConvertDialog
* do the same for geometry presets

--- rendermodes ---

* fix difference between fulldome cube and projector slice camera transform, if possible
* fix TextureOverlay equi-rect and fisheye projections angle-of-view to work with non-quadratic fbos

---- threading -----

- OK make equation threadsafe
- OK preserve a thread-storage for the gui (displaying of sequences and such)
* generally conceptualize thread-storage

---- OpenGL -----

* BUG: QImage conversion of certain texture-sizes is buggy and texture-upload crashes!

* fix TextureOverlay::PT_EQUIRECT mode for cube-mapped render

* Shaders
    * text objects and #include support

- OK concept and implementation of a generic Model container and a Model renderer

* multi-projection


---- Networking ----

* concept anyway
* scene and scene-changes passing to clients

---- timeline ----

* adjustable derivatives
* display time/value
* numerically edit time/value

---- clips -----

* clips and clip containers :D
