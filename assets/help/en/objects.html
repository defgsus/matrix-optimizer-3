<h1>Matrix Optimizer Objects</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Objects in this software are all things that can be put into the <b>object tree</b>. They can roughly be categorized into the following types:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#transformations">transformations</a></li>
<li><a href="#controlobjects">control objects</a></li>
<li><a href="#visibleobjects">visible objects</a></li>
<!-- <li><a href="#soundobjects">audible objects</a></li> -->
</ul>

<p>The object tree has the <b>Scene</b> object as it's root. All other objects are placed into the scene as children. Most objects can have children and therefore can create a hierarchy of objects. In general, in this software, an object placed inside another objects is called it's <b>children</b> and the object in which is is placed is called the <b>parent</b>. Objects can have multiple children but only one parent.</p>

<p>In general, the tree hierarchy is a means of grouping objects together. Some object positions in the tree, however, have a special meaning, as e.g. <a href="#transformations">transformation objects</a>. Also the <b>order</b> of objects on the same level is important. This order is unrelated to the position of objects in the scene view. To change the order of objects, locate the <a href="objectview.html">object view</a> and drag around the objects in the browser list as desired.</p>

<p>The properties or settings of an object, for example, the color of a 3D-model, or the resolution of a camera, are controlled by <a href="parameters">parameters</a>. Parameters themselves do not appear in the object tree. They are displayed and edited in the <a href="parameterview.html">parameter view</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a list of all objects:</p>

<a name="transformations"></a>
<h2>Transformations</h2>

<p>Transformations are all objects that change the position, scale, rotation or other things related to space. Placing a transformation object as children into, e.g., a visible object, applies the set transformation to the visible object and all other children of it. This way, a hierarchy of transformations can be archieved, by adding transformation objects at different sub-levels in the tree. Transformations on the same tree level are applied in the order of appearence, starting at the top. </p>

<p>Not all objects have a position in space, like control objects. The ones which have are the visible objects and sound objects. These objects have a position and an orientation which can be altered by transformation objects.</p>

<p>To understand the possible transformations, it's important to understand the coordinate system used in this software. It is the standard <i>left-handed</i> OpenGL coordinate system with <b>+x = right</b>, <b>+y = up</b> and <b>+z = back</b>.</p>

<a name="unitvector"></a>
<h3>unit vector</h3>
<p>It's also helpful to understand the concept of a <b>unit vector</b>. A <b>direction</b> in space can be expressed with three values, x, y and z respectively. Every transformable object in this software has a position and a direction (or orientation). A direction describes only the direction (as the name suggests) and not a distance or length. So the x,y,z-vector describing the direction generally has a length of 1.0. That makes it a unit vector. Any non-zero vector can be transformed into a unit vector by dividing it's components by the length of the vector. This is called normalizing. Generally, at all places in this software where an <b>axis</b> or <b>direction</b> can be entered, the values are internally normalized to form the unit vector.</p>
<p>Note that an axis or direction vector with all components set to zero, is illegal and will cause undesired behaviour.</p>


<p>The different transformation objects are:</p>

<h3>translation</h3>
<p>This changes the x, y and z position of it's parent. The values for the three coordinates are <b>added</b> to the current position of the object.</p>

<h3>scale</h3>
<p>This changes the size of the parent object, which can be done separately or uniformly for each axis.</p>

<h3>rotation</h3>
<p>This rotates the parent around a given axis. The rotation angle is given in degree, and in the mathematical world, positive rotations are always counter-clockwise.</p>
<p>The axis is given with the three axis parameters. For example: 1, 0, 0, means rotation around the x axis. A rotation around the diagonal xy-axis can be defined with: 1, 1, 0 (the vector is internally normalized to a <a href="#unitvector">unit vector</a>).</p>

<h3>shear</h3>
<p>A shear or skew transform deforms an object by shearing it on a certain axis. This transformation has 6 parameters which control the influence of each axis onto the other. For example, the <b>x -&gt; y</b> parameter shears the objects on the y-axis depending on the x-axis multiplied by the parameter.</p>

<h3>look at</h3>
<p>The look-at transformation changes the orientation (rotation) of it's parent. The parent's negative z-axis (this is, for example, the direction the camera object points at without any transformation applied) will point into the direction of the 3-D position given in the look-at parameters. The <b>up</b> parameter is a <a href="#unitvector">unit vector</a> axis that similiarily defines where the positive y-axis of the parent object will point at after the transformation.</p>
<p>Care must be taken to avoid degenerate transformations! For example if the look-at position is the same as the current object position, the resulting transformation will be illegal. The visual object and all of it's children will probably disappear and audio objects might emit a loud clipping signal and/or stop working. The same happens when the up-axis is equal to the look-axis.</p>

<h3>look</h3>
<p>The look transformation does essentially the same as the look-at transformation but instead of a position, it's input is a <a href="#unitvector">unit vector</a> axis. In other words, the look transformation aligns the negative z direction of it's parent to the given axis.</p>

<h3>mix</h3>
<p>This is no transformation in itself but rather a container for transformations. All children transformations can be mixed in or out with the <b>mix</b> parameter.</p>
<p>Note that 'mixing' between transformations does not always make sense. It works without problem for scale and position. But mixing into a 180 degree rotation will not rotate the object during the transition, instead it will look like a scale transformation. Think of the mix transformation as only mixing between the <b>result</b> of two transformations.</p>




<a name="soundobjects"></a>
<h2>Sound objects</h2>

<p>Sound objects are currently not part of this package . . .</p>





<a name="visibleobjects"></a>
<h2>Visible objects</h2>

<h3>order</h3>
<p>Visible objects generally are drawn in some way into the graphic output buffer. The order in which they are drawn is the order in which they are placed in the object tree, starting at the top. For 3D objects like the <a href="#model3d">model</a>, the order is more important if the object is translucent, that is, if it's color's alpha value is less than 1. See the <a href="opengldrawing.html">OpenGL drawing</a> chapter for more information.</p>

<h3>tree hierarchy</h3>
<p>Each object has it's own transformation matrix, which can be controlled via <a href="#transformations">transformation objects</a> placed inside the graphical object. When another graphical object is placed inside, it will inherit the transformation of it's parent.
</p>


<a name="camera"></a>
<h3>Camera</h3>
<p>The <a href="_object_Camera">camera</a> object is used to render the visible objects. You'll always need at least one camera. Place transformation objects inside the camera to change it's position and rotation. Use the parameters of the camera object to control the projection type, resolution and post-processing options.</p>

<p><b>Currently</b> each camera renders <b>all</b> visible object in the scene. This is likely to change in the future, when you can select which groups of objects to draw for each camera.</p>

<p>The camera has no output (texture connections will be added later). Instead, the image of the scene that is rendered is directly output to the screen. When there is more than one camera in the scene, the images are stacked on top of each other in the order of the camera objects. Use the <a href="_object_Camera.html#parameters">camera parameters</a> to control the alpha value and the type of blending. This way you can mix between different cameras.</p>


<a name="lightsource"></a>
<h3>Light source</h3>
<p>The <a href="_object_LightSource">light source</a> object creates a light for the scene, which any <a href="_object_Model3d">model</a> will recognize and use when drawing. Basic properties are the color, phong settings and directional influence. You can create many light sources at once, but they will considerably slow down rendering at some amount.</p>


<a name="model3d"></a>
<h3>3D Model</h3>
<p>This is the basic object to draw something. It has a lot of parameters which makes it very general. In every case, the <a href="_object_Model3d">model</a> will draw it's assigned <a href="geometry.html">geometry.</a> To change the geometry, right-click the object and open the <a href="geometryeditor.html">geometry editor</a>.</p>

<a name="controlobjects"></a>
<h2>Control objects</h2>

<p>Most parameters of any object can be modulated at runtime. Here starts the fun! Control objects are object that generate a value which can control a parameter. A powerful source of modulation is the <a href="_object_SequenceFloat">sequence</a> object.</p>

<p><b>Modulation</b> in this sense actually means: Whenever a parameter of an object is asked for it's value (for example, when drawing the object), the parameter will ask any connected <b>modulators</b> for their values and add this to it's own value. These modulators have also parameters which can be modulated again. You can create modulation chains of any depth while feedback loops are not allowed <b>(and in some cases aren't checked properly and will CRASH the program, sorry)</b>.</p>

<p>To <b>create a modulation</b>, you can <b>shift+drag</b> an object from the scene view onto a parameter in the object view. Or you can click on the modulation button for each parameter in the object view and select the source in the context menu. A third way is to make the parameter visible as an input connector in the scene view with the visibility button for each parameter in the object view. Then you can drag a control object onto the connector or directly connect audio outputs from audio objects.</p>

<p>Modulations can be edited via right-click context menu on a cable in the scene view, or via the context menu for the modulated parameter in the object view. The current properties are <i>amplitude</i> and <i>time offset</i>. The time offset will be added to the query time for the modulation, so the control object will modulate into the future or past.</p>

<h3>audio / control conversion</h3>
<p>Special topic, TODO!!</p>
<p>... one thing though, audio outputs will be buffered for 3 seconds when they are connected via a control signal (green cable). So a parameter can look up 3 seconds of the past audio output.</p>
<p>... and another thing. Converting control signals to audio signals is also possible by dragging the control object onto the audio input connector. Depending on the complexity of the control signal, this might be computationally expensive, because the signal must be calculated for every audio sample instead of, say, for every screen refresh. The <a href="_object_ParameterAO">audio parameter</a> object converts a modulateable parameter to an audio signal at an adjustable sample rate.</p>
