<p>This object fills it's framebuffer, using the assigned fragment shader sourcecode. The framebuffer is then mixed to the final output (e.g. a camera's output). It has no particular use in multi-projection systems since the slicing and warping is completely ignored. It is, however, very usefull to produce single frame effects of all kinds. It's also faster for rendering dome masters compared to a 5-camera-rig and a sky-box shader.</p>

<p><b>Currently</b> <a href="_object_Camera.html">cameras</a> and shader objects are the only objects that directly produce an output to the screen (the final framebuffer).</p>
