<p>This object represents a function in time. The function has one float value and can be simply thought of as <b>f(x)</b> where x is the current scene time.</p>

<p>The output of this sequence is always determined. While the functions involved in the sequence can be arbitarily complex, they will always return the correct value for a specific time. On the other hand, this makes it difficult to modulate, for example, the frequency of an oscillator. The result will not be as desired and you should use an <a href="_object_OscillatorAO">audio oscillator</a> in that case.</p>

<p>When connected to a parameter, the sequence will usually return the value at the current time to modify the parameter's output. Some parameters will read a whole block out of the sequence at once. A sequence can be querried for it's value at any time in the past or future.</p>
