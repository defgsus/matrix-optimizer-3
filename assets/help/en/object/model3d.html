<p>This is the basic object to draw something. It has a lot of parameters which makes it very general. In every case, the model will draw it's assigned <a href="geometry.html">geometry.</a> To change the geometry, right-click the object and open the <a href="geometryeditor.html">geometry editor</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, the Model3d contains exactly one geometry internally. This will change in th future, when geometries can be placed as separate objects inside a Model3d. The geometry itself contains the vertex data while the Model3d controlls how this data is drawn. For example, color, texture, bump-mapping and special effects are all controlled by the parameters of the Model3d.</p>
