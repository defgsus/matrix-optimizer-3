<p>The track can be used to group <a href="_object_SequenceFloat.html">sequences</a> together and arrange them in time. This object is mainly used for production purposes.</p>

<p><b>Currently</b> the track object is not supported in the GUI because of developmental changes. It should work but it's not tested..</p>

<p>A track, when asked for a value, will return the value of the sequence that is at the given time on that track. If there is no sequence at that time, <i>0.0</i> is returned. So instead of connecting sequences for controlling something, you connect the track and place sequences on it.</p>
