<p>The camera object is used to render the visible objects. You'll always need at least one camera. Place transformation objects inside the camera to change it's position and rotation. Use the parameters of the camera object to control the projection type, resolution and post-processing options.</p>

<p>One can select groups of objects to specifically render or exclude from rendering. By default, a camera renders all objects in the scene regardless of their position in the scene tree. Use the <i>include objects</i> and/or <i>ignore objects</i> parameters to change this. These parameters accept names or unix-style wildcards. For example, Foo* would include (or exclude) any object whos name starts with Foo. The comparison is case sensitive.</p>

<h3>output</h3>
<p>When <i>master output</i> is enabled (default), the output of the camera (the image of the scene that is rendered) is directly placed on the screen. When there is more than one camera in the scene, the images are stacked on top of each other in the order of the camera objects. Use the <a href="#parameters">camera parameters</a> to control the alpha value and the type of blending. This way you can mix between different cameras.</p>
<p>The camera also outputs it's rendered image as a texture output which can be connected to other texture-processing objects. The second texture output of the camera is the depth-map. This can be usefull for post-processing, e.g., adding fog or depth-blur.</p>

<h3>free camera</h3>
<p>The camera's location and orientation is controlled like for any other object, by placing transformation objects inside. Additionally, it is possible to control the transformation with the mouse. In the OpenGL/render window, press <b>keys 1</b> throu <b>9</b> to select the camera which to control, or <b>key 0</b> to turn of mouse-control. <b>Left-drag</b> moves up/down and left/right, <b>right-drag</b> rotates the camera view and <b>mouse-wheel</b> moves forward/backward.</p>

<p>Note that <b>currently</b> the free controlled camera is only a preview feature. The transformation can not easily be keyframed for production.</p>
