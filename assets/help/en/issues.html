<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>This software is in the making since June 2014 and still maintained by one developer. A lot of features are implemented and some are not working properly. Following is a list of things that are not fully working, not finished or open issues and TODOs in general.</p>


<ul>
    <li><b>The Help</b>
        <p>The help itself is a big construction site. General info about handling the user interface of MO is not finished. However, each object parameter and most of the widgets have short descriptions, which are displayed in the bottom of the mainwindow. Its best to load some examples and play around with them.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>User Interface</b>
        <p>A few features in the UI are created only recently and do not work as expected. For example, the CTRL+C, CTRL+V sequence in the scene editor pastes into the wrong container. Also creating connections between objects is not as convenient in all regards as it could be. A more general topic is, how to handle the size of larger scenes. There is no real sub-patch or container yet. Dragging connections between distant parts gets tedious...</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Multi-Track view</b>
        <p>The sequencer or multi-track editor is in an early stage. It's basically useable but only with patience. The context menu for each track is not working correctly. To create or remove sequences, use the scene editor. The multi-track view will update the changes when you select a track object or one of it's parents. Moving sequences around works okay.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Scripts and Shading Language</b>
        <p>There is a script language called <a href="angelscript.html">AngelScript</a> implemented which gives access to a lot of functions to modify the scene or the <a href="geometry.html">geometry</a> of visible objects. It is very likely that Python will be added as well (or maybe even replace AngelScript). The API is not cast in stone yet and is likely to undergo some modifications in the future. The same goes for the <a href="glsl.html">GLSL</a> interface. The names of uniforms and signatures of functions to modify the normal rendering of a <a href="_object_Model3d.html">Model3d</a> may not be optimal and is subject to changes as well. The author is very aware of the annoyence caused by modifying older patches to make them work in a newer version. Therefore,</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Backward Compatibility</b>
        <p>is considered one of the important issues. Whereever it is possible, i try to make new features not break old patches. Considering API changes to the script language or the GLSL interface, this is not always possible. One possibility currently considered is to create new objects for new features and keep backward compatible objects as a fallback.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Midi/OSC/Any Input/Output</b>
        <p>In general, a lot of interfaces to the outside world (apart from audio) are planned but none of them exist at the moment.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Control Interface</b>
        <p>Some work has gone into a top-level interface layer but it's not currently working because of internal changes. A control interface is supposed to abstract away all the complicated object and modulation things which are only interesting to a developer of a patch. The developer can create a simple interface with a few faders, buttons and displays that tie to the important parameters of a scene and everything else is hidden. That way, an non-tech-user is able to play with a scene, modify colors, contents, movements and such and to manage parameter presets.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Clip Controller</b>
        <p>There is a feature using <a href="_object_Clip.html">clips</a> and a <a href="_object_ClipController.html">clip controller</a> for live-control of groups of actions. This is similliar to the clip view in Ableton Live (TM). It's working in basic but running clips is not at all synched and the useability is not polished.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Path Animation</b>
        <p>Currently, the only way to control the movement of a camera or any other 3d-object is to create sequences for x, y and z. Editing those timelines is nice for fine-grained control but not very practical in general. There will be ways of drawing curves into space and to record/que a free mouse or joystick controlled movement. Also positioning and animating objects directly by dragging them around within the 3d-scene is likely to be added.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Graphics Quality</b>
        <p>This software's main focus in on animation, modulation and control of a synchronized 3d audio and visual environment. Yes, it supports textures, lighting, bump-mapping and GLSL access. Fancy effects, common in specialized frameworks like Unity (TM) or Unreal Engine (TM) take a lot of time. It would be nice to add those features over time, but that is a separate development branch.</p>
        <p>One more relevant issue is to separate geometries (meshes) and materials. Right now, those are tied together in <a href="_object_Model3d.html">Model3d</a>. It would be nice to place a bunch of geometries together and define the way they are drawn in a separate object.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Connection types</b>
        <p>Currently, the longest existing and, therefore, tested connection type is "float value" (the green cables). Text, transformation and texture connections just came recently and are not perfectly integrated yet. For example, there is no generalized concept, how to distinguish 1d, 2d or 3d textures and texture cubemaps. If a connection type does not fit to the connected input, it's silently ignored and 'some' (the last bound) texture is used instead.</p>
        <p>A signal type that is long overdue, is the event connection. It's needed for things like OSC and MIDI input and for efficiently (de)activating objects. Instead of the float value connection, which is always evaluated backwards along the whole connection chain, an event would be propagated forward and stored with it's time, for efficient look-up.</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Naming</b>
        <p>It's just when writing the documentation that the lack of consistent names for things and gui elements got apparent. This needs some thinking..</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Segfaults</b>
        <p>Any good software crashes once in a while. All crashes i encountered happended during editing not during playback, if that's any help... The sources of crashes is somewhat clear but it will need some digging to remove them.</p>
    </li>

</ul>
