<h1>AngelScript</h1>

<p>The AngelScript language can be used at various places within the Matrix Optimizer. A good place to get started is in the geometry editor. Load an angelscript preset and play with the code.</p>

<p>The api is very beta right now. Many things are likely to change soon. Except for the geometry api wich is quite stabilized.
Instead of a documentation you can find here a few examples and the complete, undocumented namespace. Check out <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript">www.angelcode.com/angelscript</a> for full language reference.</p>
